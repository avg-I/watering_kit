# Watering Kit

This sketch reflects my preferences for how the watering system should work
as well as how the code should be written.

The sketch started from the sample code provide by Elecrow and is based on it.

My changes and choices will be documented later.

The original sample code, product description and documentation can be found
on the [product page](https://www.elecrow.com/arduino-automatic-smart-plant-watering-kit.html).
